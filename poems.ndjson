always as it seems.\n\n\n\r\n    I looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,\n\r\n    And there I saw three barges of manifold adorning\n\r\n    Went sailing toward the East:\n\r\n    The first had sails like fire,\n\r\n    The next like glittering wire,\n\r\n    But sackcloth were the sails of the least;\n\r\n    And all the crews made music, and two had spread a feast.\n\n\n\r\n    The first choir breathed in flutes,\n\r\n    And fingered soft guitars;\n\r\n    The second won from lutes\n\r\n    Harmonious chords and jars,\n\r\n    With drums for stormy bars:\n\r\n    But the third was all of harpers and scarlet trumpeters;\n\r\n    Notes of triumph, then\n\r\n    An alarm again,\n\r\n    As for onset, as for victory, rallies, stirs,\n\r\n    Peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.\n\n\n\r\n    The first barge showed for figurehead a Love with wings;\n\r\n    The second showed for figurehead a Worm with stings;\n\r\n    The third, a Lily tangled to a Rose which clings.\n\r\n    The first bore for freight gold and spice and down;\n\r\n    The second bore a sword, a sceptre, and a crown;\n\r\n    The third, a heap of earth gone to dust and brown.\n\r\n    Winged Love meseemed like Folly in the face;\n\r\n    Stinged Worm meseemed loathly in his place;\n\r\n    Lily and Rose were flowers of grace.\n\n\n\r\n    Merry went the revel of the fire-sailed crew,\n\r\n    Singing, feasting, dancing to and fro:\n\r\n    Pleasures ever changing, ever graceful, ever new;\n\r\n    Sighs, but scarce of woe;\n\r\n    All the sighing\n\r\n    Wooed such sweet replying;\n\r\n    All the sighing, sweet and low,\n\r\n    Used to come and go\n\r\n    For more pleasure, merely so.\n\r\n    Yet at intervals some one grew tired\n\r\n    Of everything desired,\n\r\n    And sank, I knew not whither, in sorry plight,\n\r\n    Out of sight.\n\n\n\r\n    The second crew seemed ever\n\r\n    Wider-visioned, graver,\n\r\n    More distinct of purpose, more sustained of will;\n\r\n    With heads erect and proud,\n\r\n    And voices sometimes loud;\n\r\n    With endless tacking, counter-tacking,\n\r\n    All things grasping, all things lacking,\n\r\n    It would seem;\n\r\n    Ever shifting helm, or sail, or shroud,\n\r\n    Drifting on as in a dream.\n\r\n    Hoarding to their utmost bent,\n\r\n    Feasting to their fill,\n\r\n    Yet gnawed by discontent,\n\r\n    Envy, hatred, malice, on their road they went.\n\r\n    Their freight was not a treasure,\n\r\n    Their music not a pleasure;\n\r\n    The sword flashed, cleaving through their bands,\n\r\n    Sceptre and crown changed hands.\n\n\n\r\n    The third crew as they went\n\r\n    Seemed mostly different;\n\r\n    They toiled in rowing, for to them the wind was contrary,\n\r\n    As all the world might see.\n\r\n    They labored at the oar,\n\r\n    While on their heads they bore\n\r\n    The fiery stress of sunshine more and more.\n\r\n    They labored at the oar hand-sore,\n\r\n    Till rain went splashing,\n\r\n    And spray went dashing,\n\r\n    Down on them, and up on them, more and more.\n\r\n    Their sails were patched and rent,\n\r\n    Their masts were bent,\n\r\n    In peril of their lives they worked and went.\n\r\n    For them no feast was spread,\n\r\n    No soft luxurious bed\n\r\n    Scented and white,\n\r\n    No crown or sceptre hung in sight;\n\r\n    In weariness and painfulness,\n\r\n    In thirst and sore distress,\n\r\n    They rowed and steered from left to right\n\r\n    With all their might.\n\r\n    Their trumpeters and harpers round about\n\r\n    Incessantly played out,\n\r\n    And sometimes they made answer with a shout;\n\r\n    But oftener they groaned or wept,\n\r\n    And seldom paused to eat, and seldom slept.\n\r\n    I wept for pity watching them, but more\n\r\n    I wept heart-sore\n\r\n    Once and again to see\n\r\n    Some weary man plunge overboard, and swim\n\r\n    To Love or Worm ship floating buoyantly:\n\r\n    And there all welcomed him.\n\n\n\r\n    The ships steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other,\n\r\n    Yet all the crews were interchangeable;\n\r\n    Now one man, now another,\n\r\n    - Like bloodless spectres some, some flushed by health, -\n\r\n    Changed openly, or changed by stealth,\n\r\n    Scaling a slippery side, and scaled it well.\n\r\n    The most left Love ship, hauling wealth\n\r\n    Up Worm ship's side;\n\r\n    While some few hollow-eyed\n\r\n    Left either for the sack-sailed boat;\n\r\n    But this, though not remote,\n\r\n    Was worst to mount, and whoso left it once\n\r\n    Scarce ever came again,\n\r\n    But seemed to loathe his erst companions,\n\r\n    And wish and work them bane.\n\n\n\r\n    Then I knew (I know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread,\n\r\n    Rocks and reefs and whirlpools in the water-bed,\n\r\n    Whence a waterspout\n\r\n    Instantaneously leaped out,\n\r\n    Roaring as it reared its head.\n\n\n\r\n    Soon I spied a something dim,\n\r\n    Many-handed, grim,\n\r\n    That went flitting to and fro the first and second ship;\n\r\n    It puffed their sails full out\n\r\n    With puffs of smoky breath\n\r\n    From a smouldering lip,\n\r\n    And cleared the waterspout\n\r\n    Which reeled roaring round about\n\r\n    Threatening death.\n\r\n    With a horny hand it steered,\n\r\n    And a horn appeared\n\r\n    On its sneering head upreared\n\r\n    Haughty and high\n\r\n    Against the blackening lowering sky.\n\r\n    With a hoof it swayed the waves;\n\r\n    They opened here and there,\n\r\n    Till I spied deep ocean graves\n\r\n    Full of skeletons\n\r\n    That were men and women once\n\r\n    Foul or fair;\n\r\n    Full of things that creep\n\r\n    And fester in the deep\n\r\n    And never breathe the clean life-nurturing air.\n\n\n\r\n    The third bark held aloof\n\r\n    From the Monster with the hoof,\n\r\n    Despite his urgent beck,\n\r\n    And fraught with guile\n\r\n    Abominable his smile;\n\r\n    Till I saw him take a flying leap on to that deck.\n\r\n    Then full of awe,\n\r\n    With these same eyes I saw\n\r\n    His head incredible retract its horn\n\r\n    Rounding like babe's new born,\n\r\n    While silvery phosphorescence played\n\r\n    About his dis-horned head.\n\r\n    The sneer smoothed from his lip,\n\r\n    He beamed blandly on the ship;\n\r\n    All winds sank to a moan,\n\r\n    All waves to a monotone\n\r\n    (For all these seemed his realm),\n\r\n    While he laid a strong caressing hand upon the helm.\n\n\n\r\n    Then a cry well nigh of despair\n\r\n    Shrieked to heaven, a clamor of desperate prayer.\n\r\n    The harpers harped no more,\n\r\n    While the trumpeters sounded sore\n\r\n    An alarm to wake the dead from their bed:\n\r\n    To the rescue, to the rescue, now or never,\n\r\n    To the rescue, O ye living, O ye dead,\n\r\n    Or no more help or hope for ever! -\n\r\n    The planks strained as though they must part asunder,\n\r\n    The masts bent as though they must dip under,\n\r\n    And the winds and the waves at length\n\r\n    Girt up their strength,\n\r\n    And the depths were laid bare,\n\r\n    And heaven flashed fire and volleyed thunder\n\r\n    Through the rain-choked air,\n\r\n    And sea and sky seemed to kiss\n\r\n    In the horror and the hiss\n\r\n    Of the whole world shuddering everywhere.\n\n\n\r\n    Lo! a Flyer swooping down\n\r\n    With wings to span the globe,\n\r\n    And splendor for his robe\n\r\n    And splendor for his crown.\n\r\n    He lighted on the helm with a foot of fire,\n\r\n    And spun the Monster overboard:\n\r\n    And that monstrous thing abhorred,\n\r\n    Gnashing with balked desire,\n\r\n    Wriggled like a worm infirm\n\r\n    Up the Worm\n\r\n    Of the loathly figurehead.\n\r\n    There he crouched and gnashed;\n\r\n    And his head re-horned, and gashed\n\r\n    From the other's grapple, dripped bloody red.\n\n\n\r\n    I saw that thing accurst\n\r\n    Wreak his worst\n\r\n    On the first and second crew:\n\r\n    Some with baited hook\n\r\n    He angled for and took,\n\r\n    Some dragged overboard in a net he threw,\n\r\n    Some he did to death\n\r\n    With hoof or horn or blasting breath.\n\n\n\r\n    I heard a voice of wailing\n\r\n    Where the ships went sailing,\n\r\n    A sorrowful voice prevailing\n\r\n    Above the sound of the sea,\n\r\n    Above the singers' voices,\n\r\n    And musical merry noises;\n\r\n    All songs had turned to sighing,\n\r\n    The light was failing,\n\r\n    The day was dying -\n\r\n    Ah me,\n\r\n    That such a sorrow should be!\n\n\n\r\n    There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land\n\r\n    When Love ship went down by the bottomless quicksand\n\r\n    To its grave in the bitter wave.\n\r\n    There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land\n\r\n    When Worm ship went to pieces on the rock-bound strand,\n\r\n    And the bitter wave was its grave.\n\r\n    But land and sea waxed hoary\n\r\n    In whiteness of a glory\n\r\n    Never told in story\n\r\n    Nor seen by mortal eye,\n\r\n    When the third ship crossed the bar\n\r\n    Where whirls and breakers are,\n\r\n    And steered into the splendors of the sky;\n\r\n    That third bark and that least\n\r\n    Which had never seemed to feast,\n\r\n    Yet kept high festival above sun and moon and star."}

stone\n\r\n        And fasten it strong I implore\n\r\n        With iron bars, and let it be chain'd\n\r\n        With three chains to the church floor.\n\n\n\r\n        And bless the chains and sprinkle them,\n\r\n        And let fifty priests stand round,\n\r\n        Who night and day the mass may say\n\r\n        Where I lie on the ground.\n\n\n\r\n        And let fifty choristers be there\n\r\n        The funeral dirge to sing,\n\r\n        Who day and night by the taper's light\n\r\n        Their aid to me may bring.\n\n\n\r\n        Let the church bells all both great and small\n\r\n        Be toll'd by night and day,\n\r\n        To drive from thence the fiends who come\n\r\n        To bear my corpse away.\n\n\n\r\n        And ever have the church door barr'd\n\r\n        After the even song,\n\r\n        And I beseech you children dear\n\r\n        Let the bars and bolts be strong.\n\n\n\r\n        And let this be three days and nights\n\r\n        My wretched corpse to save,\n\r\n        Preserve me so long from the fiendish throng\n\r\n        And then I may rest in my grave.\n\n\n\r\n        The Old Woman of Berkeley laid her down\n\r\n        And her eyes grew deadly dim,\n\r\n        Short came her breath and the struggle of death\n\r\n        Did loosen every limb.\n\n\n\r\n        They blest the old woman's winding sheet\n\r\n        With rites and prayers as due,\n\r\n        With holy water they sprinkled her shroud\n\r\n        And they sprinkled her coffin too.\n\n\n\r\n        And they chain'd her in her coffin of stone\n\r\n        And with iron barr'd it down,\n\r\n        And in the church with three strong chains\n\r\n        They chain'd it to the ground.\n\n\n\r\n        And they blest the chains and sprinkled them,\n\r\n        And fifty priests stood round,\n\r\n        By night and day the mass to say\n\r\n        Where she lay on the ground.\n\n\n\r\n        And fifty choristers were there\n\r\n        To sing the funeral song,\n\r\n        And a hallowed taper blazed in the hand\n\r\n        Of all the sacred throng.\n\n\n\r\n        To see the priests and choristers\n\r\n        It was a goodly sight,\n\r\n        Each holding, as it were a staff,\n\r\n        A taper burning bright.\n\n\n\r\n        And the church bells all both great and small\n\r\n        Did toll so loud and long,\n\r\n        And they have barr'd the church door hard\n\r\n        After the even song.\n\n\n\r\n        And the first night the taper's light\n\r\n        Burnt steadily and clear.\n\r\n        But they without a hideous rout\n\r\n        Of angry fiends could hear;\n\n\n\r\n        A hideous roar at the church door\n\r\n        Like a long thunder peal,\n\r\n        And the priests they pray'd and the choristers sung\n\r\n        Louder in fearful zeal.\n\n\n\r\n        Loud toll'd the bell, the priests pray'd well,\n\r\n        The tapers they burnt bright,\n\r\n        The monk her son, and her daughter the nun\n\r\n        They told their beads all night.\n\n\n\r\n        The cock he crew, away they flew\n\r\n        The fiends from the herald of day,\n\r\n        And undisturb'd the choristers sing\n\r\n        And the fifty priests they pray.\n\n\n\r\n        The second night the taper's light\n\r\n        Burnt dismally and blue,\n\r\n        And every one saw his neighbour's face\n\r\n        Like a dead man's face to view.\n\n\n\r\n        And yells and cries without arise\n\r\n        That the stoutest heart might shock,\n\r\n        And a deafening roaring like a cataract pouring\n\r\n        Over a mountain rock.\n\n\n\r\n        The monk and nun they told their beads\n\r\n        As fast as they could tell,\n\r\n        And aye as louder grew the noise\n\r\n        The faster went the bell.\n\n\n\r\n        Louder and louder the choristers sung\n\r\n        As they trembled more and more,\n\r\n        And the fifty priests prayed to heaven for aid,\n\r\n        They never had prayed so before.\n\n\n\r\n        The cock he crew, away they flew\n\r\n        The fiends from the herald of day,\n\r\n        And undisturb'd the choristers sing\n\r\n        And the fifty priests they pray.\n\n\n\r\n        The third night came and the tapers flame\n\r\n        A hideous stench did make,\n\r\n        And they burnt as though they had been dipt\n\r\n        In the burning brimstone lake.\n\n\n\r\n        And the loud commotion, like the rushing of ocean,\n\r\n        Grew momently more and more,\n\r\n        And strokes as of a battering ram\n\r\n        Did shake the strong church door.\n\n\n\r\n        The bellmen they for very fear\n\r\n        Could toll the bell no longer,\n\r\n        And still as louder grew the strokes\n\r\n        Their fear it grew the stronger.\n\n\n\r\n        The monk and nun forgot their beads,\n\r\n        They fell on the ground dismay'd,\n\r\n        There was not a single saint in heaven\n\r\n        Whom they did not call to aid.\n\n\n\r\n        And the choristers song that late was so strong\n\r\n        Grew a quaver of consternation,\n\r\n        For the church did rock as an earthquake shock\n\r\n        Uplifted its foundation.\n\n\n\r\n        And a sound was heard like the trumpet's blast\n\r\n        That shall one day wake the dead,\n\r\n        The strong church door could bear no more\n\r\n        And the bolts and the bars they fled.\n\n\n\r\n        And the taper's light was extinguish'd quite,\n\r\n        And the choristers faintly sung,\n\r\n        And the priests dismay'd, panted and prayed\n\r\n        Till fear froze every tongue.\n\n\n\r\n        And in He came with eyes of flame\n\r\n        The Fiend to fetch the dead,\n\r\n        And all the church with his presence glowed\n\r\n        Like a fiery furnace red.\n\n\n\r\n        He laid his hand on the iron chains\n\r\n        And like flax they moulder'd asunder,\n\r\n        And the coffin lid that was barr'd so firm\n\r\n        He burst with his voice of thunder.\n\n\n\r\n        And he bade the Old Woman of Berkeley rise\n\r\n        And come with her master away,\n\r\n        And the cold sweat stood on the cold cold corpse,\n\r\n        At the voice she was forced to obey.\n\n\n\r\n        She rose on her feet in her winding sheet,\n\r\n        Her dead flesh quivered with fear,\n\r\n        And a groan like that which the Old Woman gave\n\r\n        Never did mortal hear.\n\n\n\r\n        She followed the fiend to the church door,\n\r\n        There stood a black horse there,\n\r\n        His breath was red like furnace smoke,\n\r\n        His eyes like a meteor's glare.\n\n\n\r\n        The fiendish force flung her on the horse\n\r\n        And he leapt up before,\n\r\n        And away like the lightning's speed

The master came\n\r\n        In his old woven dress;\n\r\n    I stood in joy, and yet in shame,\n\r\n        Oppressed with earthliness.\n\n\n\r\n    He stretched his arms, and gently sought\n\r\n        To clasp me to his soul;\n\r\n    I shrunk away, because I thought\n\r\n        He did not know the whole.\n\n\n\r\n    I did not love him as I would,\n\r\n        Embraces were not meet;\n\r\n    I sank before him where he stood,\n\r\n        And held and kissed his feet.\n\n\n\r\n    Ten years have passed away since then,\n\r\n        Oft hast thou come to me;\n\r\n    The question scarce will rise again,\n\r\n        Whether I care for thee.\n\n\n\r\n    To every doubt, in thee my heart\n\r\n        An answer hopes to find;\n\r\n    In every gladness, Lord, thou art,\n\r\n        The deeper joy behind.\n\n\n\r\n    And yet in other realms of life,\n\r\n        Unknown temptations rise,\n\r\n    Unknown perplexities and strife,\n\r\n        New questions and replies.\n\n\n\r\n    And every lesson learnt, anew,\n\r\n        The vain assurance lends\n\r\n    That now I know, and now can do,\n\r\n        And now should see thy ends.\n\n\n\r\n    So I forget I am a child,\n\r\n        And act as if a man;\n\r\n    Who through the dark and tempest wild\n\r\n        Will go, because he can.\n\n\n\r\n    And so, O Lord, not yet I dare\n\r\n        To clasp thee to my breast;\n\r\n    Though well I know that only there\n\r\n        Is hid the secret rest.\n\n\n\r\n    And yet I shrink not, as at first:\n\r\n        Be thou the judge of guilt;\n\r\n    Thou knowest all my best and worst,\n\r\n        Do with me as thou wilt.\n\n\n\r\n    Spread thou once more thine arms abroad,\n\r\n        Lay bare thy bosom's beat;\n\r\n    Thou shalt embrace me, O my God,\n\r\n        And I will kiss thy feet.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    2.\n\n\n\r\n    I stood before my childhood's home,\n\r\n        Outside the belt of trees;\n\r\n    All round, my dreaming glances roam\n\r\n        On well-known hills and leas.\n\n\n\r\n    When sudden, from the westward, rushed\n\r\n        A wide array of waves;\n\r\n    Over the subject fields they gushed\n\r\n        From far-off, unknown caves.\n\n\n\r\n    And up the hill they clomb and came,\n\r\n        On flowing like a sea:\n\r\n    I saw, and watched them like a game;\n\r\n        No terror woke in me.\n\n\n\r\n    For just the belting trees within,\n\r\n        I saw my father wait;\n\r\n    And should the waves the summit win,\n\r\n        I would go through the gate.\n\n\n\r\n    For by his side all doubt was dumb,\n\r\n        And terror ceased to foam;\n\r\n    No great sea-billows dared to come,\n\r\n        And tread the holy home.\n\n\n\r\n    Two days passed by. With restless toss,\n\r\n        The red flood brake its doors;\n\r\n    Prostrate I lay, and looked across\n\r\n        To the eternal shores.\n\n\n\r\n    The world was fair, and hope was nigh,\n\r\n        Some men and women true;\n\r\n    And I was strong, and Death and I\n\r\n        Would have a hard ado.\n\n\n\r\n    And so I shrank. But sweet and good\n\r\n        The dream came to my aid;\n\r\n    Within the trees my father stood,\n\r\n        I must not be dismayed.\n\n\n\r\n    My grief was his, not mine alone;\n\r\n        The waves that burst in fears,\n\r\n    He heard not only with his own,\n\r\n        But heard them with my ears.\n\n\n\r\n    My life and death belong to thee,\n\r\n        For I am thine, O God;\n\r\n    Thy hands have made and fashioned me,\n\r\n        'Tis thine to bear the load.\n\n\n\r\n    And thou shalt bear it. I will try\n\r\n        To be a peaceful child,\n\r\n    Whom in thy arms right tenderly\n\r\n        Thou carriest through the wild.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    3.\n\n\n\r\n    The rich man mourns his little loss,\n\r\n        And knits the brow of care;\n\r\n    The poor man tries to bear the cross,\n\r\n        And seeks relief in prayer.\n\n\n\r\n    Some gold had vanished from my purse,\n\r\n        Which I had watched but ill;\n\r\n    I feared a lack, but feared yet worse\n\r\n        Regret returning still.\n\n\n\r\n    And so I knelt and prayed my prayer\n\r\n        To Him who maketh strong,\n\r\n    That no returning thoughts of care\n\r\n        Should do my spirit wrong.\n\n\n\r\n    I rose in peace, in comfort went,\n\r\n        And laid me down to rest;\n\r\n    But straight my soul grew confident\n\r\n        With gladness of the blest.\n\n\n\r\n    For ere the sleep that care redeems,\n\r\n        My soul such visions had,\n\r\n    That never child in childhood's dreams\n\r\n        Was more exulting glad.\n\n\n\r\n    No white-robed angels floated by\n\r\n        On slow, reposing wings;\n\r\n    I only saw, with inward eye,\n\r\n        Some very common things.\n\n\n\r\n    First rose the scarlet pimpernel,\n\r\n        With burning purple heart;\n\r\n    I saw it, and I knew right well\n\r\n        The lesson of its art.\n\n\n\r\n    Then came the primrose, childlike flower;\n\r\n        It looked me in the face;\n\r\n    It bore a message full of power,\n\r\n        And confidence, and grace.\n\n\n\r\n    And winds arose on uplands wild,\n\r\n        And bathed me like a stream;\n\r\n    And sheep-bells babbled round the child\n\r\n        Who loved them in a dream.\n\n\n\r\n    Henceforth my mind was never crossed\n\r\n        By thought of vanished gold,\n\r\n    But with it came the guardian host\n\r\n        Of flowers both meek and bold.\n\n\n\r\n    The loss is riches while I live,\n\r\n        A joy I would not lose:\n\r\n    Choose ever, God, what Thou wilt give,\n\r\n        Not leaving me to choose.\n\n\n\r\n    \n\"What said the flowers in whisper low,\n\r\n        To soothe me into rest?\"\n\r\n    I scarce have words--they seemed to grow\n\r\n        Right out of God's own breast.\n\n\n\r\n    They said, God meant the flowers He made,\n\r\n        As children see the same;\n\r\n    They said the words the lilies said\n\r\n        When Jesus looked at them.\n\n\n\r\n    And if you want to hear the flowers\n\r\n        Speak ancient words, all new,\n\r\n    They may, if you, in darksome hours,\n\r\n        Ask God to comfort you.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    4.\n\n\n\r\n    Our souls, in daylight hours, awake,\n\r\n        With visions sometimes teem,\n\r\n    Which to the slumbering brain would take\n\r\n        The form of wondrous dream.\n\n\n\r\n    Thus, once, I saw a level space,\n\r\n        With circling mountains nigh;\n\r\n    And round it grouped all forms of grace,\n\r\n        A goodly company.\n\n\n\r\n    And at one end, with gentle rise,\n\r\n        Stood something like a throne;\n\r\n    And thither all the radiant eyes,\n\r\n        As to a centre, shone.\n\n\n\r\n    And on the seat the noblest form\n\r\n        Of glory, dim-descried;\n\r\n    His glance would quell all passion-storm,\n\r\n        All doubt, and fear, and pride.\n\n\n\r\n    But lo! his eyes far-fixed burn\n\r\n        Adown the widening vale;\n\r\n    The looks of all obedient turn,\n\r\n        And soon those looks are pale.\n\n\n\r\n    For, through the shining multitude,\n\r\n        With feeble step and slow,\n\r\n    A weary man, in garments rude,\n\r\n        All falteringly did go.\n\n\n\r\n    His face was white, and still-composed,\n\r\n        Like one that had been dead;\n\r\n    The eyes, from eyelids half unclosed,\n\r\n        A faint, wan splendour shed.\n\n\n\r\n    And to his brow a strange wreath clung,\n\r\n        And drops of crimson hue;\n\r\n    And his rough hands, oh, sadly wrung!\n\r\n        Were pierced through and through.\n\n\n\r\n    And not a look he turned aside;\n\r\n        His eyes were forward bent;\n\r\n    And slow the eyelids opened wide,\n\r\n        As towards the throne he went.\n\n\n\r\n    At length he reached the mighty throne,\n\r\n        And sank upon his knees;\n\r\n    And clasped his hands with stifled groan,\n\r\n        And spake in words like these:--\n\n\n\r\n    \"Father, I am come back--Thy will\n\r\n        Is sometimes hard to do.\"\n\r\n    From all the multitude so still,\n\r\n        A sound of weeping grew.\n\n\n\r\n    And mournful-glad came down the One,\n\r\n        And kneeled, and clasped His child;\n\r\n    Sank on His breast the outworn man,\n\r\n        And wept until he smiled.\n\n\n\r\n    And when their tears had stilled their sighs,\n\r\n        And joy their tears had dried,\n\r\n    The people saw, with lifted eyes,\n\r\n        Them seated side by side.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    5.\n\n\n\r\n    I lay and dreamed. Three crosses stood\n\r\n        Amid the gloomy air.\n\r\n    Two bore two men--one was the Good;\n\r\n        The third rose waiting, bare.\n\n\n\r\n    A Roman soldier, coming by,\n\r\n        Mistook me for the third;\n\r\n    I lifted up my asking eye\n\r\n        For Jesus' sign or word.\n\n\n\r\n    I thought He signed that I should yield,\n\r\n        And give the error way.\n\r\n    I held my peace; no word revealed,\n\r\n        No gesture uttered \nnay.\n\n\n\r\n    Against the cross a scaffold stood,\n\r\n        Whence easy hands could nail\n\r\n    The doomed upon that altar-wood,\n\r\n        Whose fire burns slow and pale.\n\n\n\r\n    Upon this ledge he lifted me.\n\r\n        I stood all thoughtful there,\n\r\n    Waiting until the deadly tree\n\r\n        My form for fruit should bear.\n\n\n\r\n    Rose up the waves of fear and doubt,\n\r\n        Rose up from heart to brain;\n\r\n    They shut the world of vision out,\n\r\n        And thus they cried amain:\n\n\n\r\n    \"Ah me! my hands--the hammer's knock--\n\r\n        The nails--the tearing strength!\"\n\r\n    My soul replied: \"'Tis but a shock,\n\r\n        That grows to pain at length.\"\n\n\n\r\n    \"Ah me! the awful fight with death;\n\r\n        The hours to hang and die;\n\r\n    The thirsting gasp for common breath,\n\r\n        That passes heedless by!\"\n\n\n\r\n    My soul replied: \"A faintness soon\n\r\n        Will shroud thee in its fold;\n\r\n    The hours will go,--the fearful noon\n\r\n        Rise, pass--and thou art cold.\n\n\n\r\n    \"And for thy suffering, what to thee\n\r\n        Is that? or care of thine?\n\r\n    Thou living branch upon the tree\n\r\n        Whose root is the Divine!\n\n\n\r\n    \"'Tis His to care that thou endure;\n\r\n        That pain shall grow or fade;\n\r\n    With bleeding hands hang on thy cure,\n\r\n        He knows what He hath made.\"\n\n\n\r\n    And still, for all the inward wail,\n\r\n        My foot was firmly pressed;\n\r\n    For still the fear lest I should fail\n\r\n        Was stronger than the rest.\n\n\n\r\n    And thus I stood, until the strife\n\r\n        The bonds of slumber brake;\n\r\n    I felt as I had ruined life,\n\r\n        Had fled, and come awake.\n\n\n\r\n    Yet I was glad, my heart confessed,\n\r\n        The trial went not on;\n\r\n    Glad likewise I had stood the test,\n\r\n        As far as it had gone.\n\n\n\r\n    And yet I fear some recreant thought,\n\r\n        Which now I all forget,\n\r\n    That painful feeling in me wrought\n\r\n        Of failure, lingering yet.\n\n\n\r\n    And if the dream had had its scope,\n\r\n        I might have fled the field;\n\r\n    But yet I thank Thee for the hope,\n\r\n        And think I dared not yield.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    6.\n\n\n\r\n    Methinks I hear, as I lie slowly dying,\n\r\n        Indulgent friends say, weeping, \"\nHe was good.\n\"\n\r\n    I fail to speak, a faint denial trying,--\n\r\n        They answer, \"\nHis humility withstood.\n\"\n\n\n\r\n    I, knowing better, part with love unspoken;\n\r\n        And find the unknown world not all unknown.\n\r\n    The bonds that held me from my centre broken,\n\r\n        I seek my home, the Saviour's homely throne.\n\n\n\r\n    How He will greet me, I walk on and wonder;\n\r\n        And think I know what I will say to Him.\n\r\n    I fear no sapphire floor of cloudy thunder,\n\r\n        I fear no passing vision great and dim.\n\n\n\r\n    But He knows all my unknown weary story:\n\r\n        How will He judge me, pure, and good, and fair?\n\r\n    I come to Him in all His conquered glory,\n\r\n        Won from such life as I went dreaming there!\n\n\n\r\n    I come; I fall before Him, faintly saying:\n\r\n        \"Ah, Lord, shall I thy loving favour win?\n\r\n    Earth's beauties tempted me; my walk was straying--\n\r\n        I have no honour--but may I come in?\"\n\n\n\r\n    \"I know thee well.

I will dream this windy day;\n\r\n        No sunny spot is bare;\n\r\n    Dull vapours, in uncomely play,\n\r\n        Are weltering through the air.\n\r\n    If I throw wide my windowed breast\n\r\n        To all the blasts that blow,\n\r\n    My soul will rival in unrest\n\r\n        Those tree-tops--how they go!\n\n\n\r\n    But I will dream like any child;\n\r\n        For, lo! a mighty swan,\n\r\n    With radiant plumage undented,\n\r\n        And folded airy van,\n\r\n    With serpent neck all proudly bent,\n\r\n        And stroke of swarthy oar,\n\r\n    Dreams on to me, by sea-maids sent\n\r\n        Over the billows hoar.\n\n\n\r\n    For in a wave-worn rock I lie;\n\r\n        Outside, the waters foam;\n\r\n    And echoes of old storms go by\n\r\n        Within my sea-built dome.\n\r\n    The waters, half the gloomy way,\n\r\n        Beneath its arches come;\n\r\n    Throbbing to unseen billows' play,\n\r\n        The green gulfs waver dumb.\n\n\n\r\n    A dawning twilight through the cave\n\r\n        In moony gleams doth go,\n\r\n    Half from the swan above the wave,\n\r\n        Half from the swan below.\n\r\n    Close to my feet she gently drifts,\n\r\n        Among the glistening things;\n\r\n    She stoops her crowny head, and lifts\n\r\n        White shoulders of her wings.\n\n\n\r\n    Oh! earth is rich with many a nest,\n\r\n        Deep, soft, and ever new,\n\r\n    Pure, delicate, and full of rest;\n\r\n        But dearest there are two.\n\r\n    I would not tell them but to minds\n\r\n        That are as white as they;\n\r\n    If others hear, of other kinds,\n\r\n        I wish them far away.\n\n\n\r\n    Upon the neck, between the wings,\n\r\n        Of a white, sailing swan,\n\r\n    A flaky bed of shelterings--\n\r\n        There you will find the one.\n\r\n    The other--well, it will not out,\n\r\n        Nor need I tell it you;\n\r\n    I've told you one, and need you doubt,\n\r\n        When there are only two?\n\n\n\r\n    Fulfil old dreams, O splendid bird,\n\r\n        Me o'er the waters bear;\n\r\n    Sure never ocean's face was stirred\n\r\n        By any ship so fair!\n\r\n    Sure never whiteness found a dress,\n\r\n        Upon the earth to go,\n\r\n    So true, profound, and rich, unless\n\r\n        It was the falling snow.\n\n\n\r\n    With quick short flutter of each wing\n\r\n        Half-spread, and stooping crown,\n\r\n    She calls me; and with one glad spring\n\r\n        I nestle in the down.\n\r\n    Plunges the bark, then bounds aloft,\n\r\n        With lessening dip and rise.\n\r\n    Round curves her neck with motion soft--\n\r\n        Sure those are woman's eyes.\n\n\n\r\n    One stroke unseen, with oary feet,\n\r\n        One stroke--away she sweeps;\n\r\n    Over the waters pale we fleet,\n\r\n        Suspended in the deeps.\n\r\n    And round the sheltering rock, and lo!\n\r\n        The tumbling, weltering sea!\n\r\n    On to the west, away we go,\n\r\n     Over the waters free!\n\n\n\r\n    Her motions moulded to the wave,\n\r\n        Her billowy neck thrown back,\n\r\n    With slow strong pulse, stately and grave,\n\r\n        She cleaves a rippling track.\n\r\n    And up the mounting wave we glide,\n\r\n        With climbing sweeping blow;\n\r\n    And down the steep, far-sloping side,\n\r\n        To flowing vales below.\n\n\n\r\n    I hear the murmur of the deep\n\r\n        In countless ripples pass,\n\r\n    Like talking children in their sleep,\n\r\n        Like winds in reedy grass.\n\r\n    And through some ruffled feathers, I\n\r\n        The glassy rolling mark,\n\r\n    With which the waves eternally\n\r\n        Roll on from dawn to dark.\n\n\n\r\n    The night is blue, the stars aglow;\n\r\n        In solemn peace o'erhead\n\r\n    The archless depth of heaven; below,\n\r\n        The murmuring, heaving bed.\n\r\n    A thickened night, it heaveth on,\n\r\n        A fallen earthly sky;\n\r\n    The shadows of its stars alone\n\r\n        Are left to know it by.\n\n\n\r\n    What faints across the lifted loop\n\r\n     Of cloud-veil upward cast?\n\r\n    With sea-veiled limbs, a sleeping group\n\r\n        Of Nereids dreaming past.\n\r\n    Swim on, my boat; who knows but I,\n\r\n        Ere night sinks to her grave,\n\r\n    May see in splendour pale float by\n\r\n        The Venus of the wave?\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    2.\n\n\n\r\n    In the night, round a lady dreaming--\n\r\n        A queen among the dreams--\n\r\n    Came the silent sunset streaming,\n\r\n        Mixed with the voice of streams.\n\r\n    A silver fountain springing\n\r\n        Blossoms in molten gold;\n\r\n    And the airs of the birds float ringing\n\r\n        Through harmonies manifold.\n\n\n\r\n    She lies in a watered valley;\n\r\n        Her garden melts away\n\r\n    Through foot-path and curving alley\n\r\n        Into the wild wood grey.\n\r\n    And the green of the vale goes creeping\n\r\n        To the feet of the rugged hills,\n\r\n    Where the moveless rocks are keeping\n\r\n        The homes of the wandering rills.\n\n\n\r\n    And the hues of the flowers grow deeper,\n\r\n        Till they dye her very brain;\n\r\n    And their scents, like the soul of a sleeper,\n\r\n        Wander and waver and rain.\n\r\n    For dreams have a wealth of glory\n\r\n        That daylight cannot give:\n\r\n    Ah God! make the hope a story--\n\r\n        Bid the dreams arise and live.\n\n\n\r\n    She lay and gazed at the flowers,\n\r\n        Till her soul's own garden smiled\n\r\n    With blossom-o'ershaded bowers,\n\r\n        Great colours and splendours wild.\n\r\n    And her heart filled up with gladness,\n\r\n        Till it could only ache;\n\r\n    And it turned aside to sadness,\n\r\n        As if for pity's sake.\n\n\n\r\n    And a fog came o'er the meadows,\n\r\n        And the rich hues fainting lay;\n\r\n    Came from the woods the shadows,\n\r\n        Came from the rocks the grey.\n\r\n    And the sunset thither had vanished,\n\r\n        Where the sunsets always go;\n\r\n    And the sounds of the stream were banished,\n\r\n        As if slain by frost and snow.\n\n\n\r\n    And the flowers paled fast and faster,\n\r\n        And they crumbled fold on fold,\n\r\n    Till they looked like the stained plaster\n\r\n        Of a cornice in ruin old.\n\r\n    And they blackened and shrunk together,\n\r\n        As if scorched by the breath of flame,\n\r\n    With a sad perplexity whether\n\r\n        They were or were not the same.\n\n\n\r\n    And she saw herself still lying,\n\r\n        And smiling on, the while;\n\r\n    And the smile, instead of dying,\n\r\n        Was fixed in an idiot smile.\n\r\n    And the lady arose in sorrow\n\r\n        Out of her sleep's dark stream;\n\r\n    But her dream made dark the morrow,\n\r\n        And she told me the haunting dream.\n\n\n\r\n    Alas! dear lady, I know it,\n\r\n        The dream that all is a dream;\n\r\n    The joy with the doubt below it\n\r\n        That the bright things only seem.\n\r\n    One moment of sad commotion,\n\r\n        And one of doubt's withering rule--\n\r\n    And the great wave-pulsing ocean\n\r\n        Is only a gathered pool.\n\n\n\r\n    And the flowers are spots of painting,\n\r\n        Of lifeless staring hue;\n\r\n    Though your heart is sick to fainting,\n\r\n        They say not a word to you.\n\r\n    And the birds know nought of gladness,\n\r\n        They are only song-machines;\n\r\n    And a man is a skilful madness,\n\r\n        And the women pictured queens.\n\n\n\r\n    And fiercely we dig the fountain,\n\r\n        To know the water true;\n\r\n    And we climb the crest of the mountain,\n\r\n        To part it from the blue.\n\r\n    But we look too far before us\n\r\n        For that which is more than nigh;\n\r\n    Though the sky is lofty o'er us,\n\r\n        We are always in the sky.\n\n\n\r\n    And the fog, o'er the roses that creepeth,\n\r\n        Steams from the unknown sea,\n\r\n    In the dark of the soul that sleepeth,\n\r\n        And sigheth constantly,\n\r\n    Because o'er the face of its waters\n\r\n        The breathing hath not gone;\n\r\n    And instead of glad sons and daughters,\n\r\n        Wild things are moaning on.\n\n\n\r\n    When the heart knows well the Father,\n\r\n        The eyes will be always day;\n\r\n    But now they grow dim the rather\n\r\n        That the light is more than they.\n\r\n    Believe, amidst thy sorrows,\n\r\n        That the blight that swathes the earth\n\r\n    Is only a shade that borrows\n\r\n        Life from thy spirit's dearth.\n\n\n\r\n    God's heart is the fount of beauty;\n\r\n        Thy heart is its visible well;\n\r\n    If it vanish, do thou thy duty,\n\r\n        That necromantic spell;\n\r\n    And thy heart to the Father crying\n\r\n        Will fill with waters deep;\n\r\n    Thine eyes may say, \nBeauty is dying;\n\r\n        But thy spirit, \nShe goes to sleep.\n\n\n\r\n    And I fear not, thy fair soul ever\n\r\n        Will smile as thy image smiled;\n\r\n    It had fled with a sudden shiver,\n\r\n        And thy body lay beguiled.\n\r\n    Let the flowers and thy beauty perish;\n\r\n        Let them go to the ancient dust.\n\r\n    But the hopes that the children cherish,\n\r\n        They are the Father's trust.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    3.\n\n\n\r\n    A great church in an empty square,\n\r\n        A place of echoing tones;\n\r\n    Feet pass not oft enough to wear\n\r\n        The grass between the stones.\n\n\n\r\n    The jarring sounds that haunt its gates,\n\r\n        Like distant thunders boom;\n\r\n    The boding heart half-listening waits,\n\r\n        As for a coming doom.\n\n\n\r\n    The door stands wide, the church is bare,\n\r\n        Oh, horror, ghastly, sore!\n\r\n    A gulf of death, with hideous stare,\n\r\n        Yawns in the earthen floor;\n\n\n\r\n    As if the ground had sunk away\n\r\n        Into a void below:\n\r\n    Its shapeless sides of dark-hued clay\n\r\n        Hang ready aye to go.\n\n\n\r\n    I am myself a horrid grave,\n\r\n        My very heart turns grey;\n\r\n    This charnel-hole,--will no one save\n\r\n        And force my feet away?\n\n\n\r\n    The changing dead are there, I know,\n\r\n        In terror ever new;\n\r\n    Yet down the frightful slope I go,\n\r\n        That downward goeth too.\n\n\n\r\n    Beneath the caverned floor I hie,\n\r\n        And seem, with anguish dull,\n\r\n    To enter by the empty eye\n\r\n        Into a monstrous skull.\n\n\n\r\n    Stumbling on what I dare not guess,\n\r\n        And wading through the gloom,\n\r\n    Less deep the shades my eyes oppress,\n\r\n        I see the awful tomb.\n\n\n\r\n    My steps have led me to a door,\n\r\n        With iron clenched and barred;\n\r\n    Grim Death hides there a ghastlier store,\n\r\n        Great spider in his ward.\n\n\n\r\n    The portals shake, the bars are bowed,\n\r\n        As if an earthy wind\n\r\n    That never bore a leaf or cloud\n\r\n        Were pressing hard behind.\n\n\n\r\n    They shake, they groan, they outward strain.\n\r\n        What sight, of dire dismay\n\r\n    Will freeze its form upon my brain,\n\r\n        And turn it into clay?\n\n\n\r\n    They shake, they groan, they bend, they crack;\n\r\n        The bars, the doors divide:\n\r\n    A flood of glory at their back\n\r\n        Hath burst the portals wide.\n\n\n\r\n    Flows in the light of vanished days,\n\r\n        The joy of long-set moons;\n\r\n    The flood of radiance billowy plays,\n\r\n        In sweet-conflicting tunes.\n\n\n\r\n    The gulf is filled with flashing tides,\n\r\n        An awful gulf no more;\n\r\n    A maze of ferns clothes all its sides,\n\r\n        Of mosses all its floor.\n\n\n\r\n    And, floating through the streams, appear\n\r\n        Such forms of beauty rare,\n\r\n    As every aim at beauty here\n\r\n        Had found its \nwould be\n there.\n\n\n\r\n    I said: 'Tis well no hand came nigh,\n\r\n        To turn my steps astray;\n\r\n    'Tis good we cannot choose but die,\n\r\n        That life may have its way.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    4.\n\n\n\r\n    Before I sleep, some dreams draw nigh,\n\r\n        Which are not fancy mere;\n\r\n    For sudden lights an inward eye,\n\r\n        And wondrous things appear.\n\n\n\r\n    Thus, unawares, with vision wide,\n\r\n        A steep hill once I saw,\n\r\n    In faint dream lights, which ever hide\n\r\n        Their fountain and their law.\n\n\n\r\n    And up and down the hill reclined\n\r\n        A host of statues old;\n\r\n    Such wondrous forms as you might find\n\r\n        Deep under ancient mould.\n\n\n\r\n    They lay, wild scattered, all along,\n\r\n        And maimed as if in fight;\n\r\n    But every one of all the throng\n\r\n        Was precious to the sight.\n\n\n\r\n    Betwixt the night and hill they ranged,\n\r\n        In dead composure cast.\n\r\n    As suddenly the dream was changed,\n\r\n        And all the wonder past.\n\n\n\r\n    The hill remained; but what it bore\n\r\n        Was broken reedy stalks,\n\r\n    Bent hither, thither, drooping o'er,\n\r\n        Like flowers o'er weedy walks.\n\n\n\r\n    For each dim form of marble rare,\n\r\n        Bent a wind-broken reed;\n\r\n    So hangs on autumn-field, long-bare,\n\r\n     Some tall and straggling weed.\n\n\n\r\n    The autumn night hung like a pall,\n\r\n        Hung mournfully and dead;\n\r\n    And if a wind had waked at all,\n\r\n        It had but moaned and fled.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    5.\n\n\n\r\n    I lay and dreamed. Of thought and sleep\n\r\n        Was born a heavenly joy:\n\r\n    I dreamed of two who always keep\n\r\n        Me happy as a boy.\n\n\n\r\n    I was with them. My heart-bells rung\n\r\n        With joy my heart above;\n\r\n    Their present heaven my earth o'erhung,\n\r\n        And earth was glad with love.\n\n\n\r\n    The dream grew troubled. Crowds went on,\n\r\n        And sought their varied ends;\n\r\n    Till stream on stream, the crowds had gone,\n\r\n        And swept away my friends.\n\n\n\r\n    I was alone. A miry road\n\r\n        I followed, all in vain;\n\r\n    No well-known hill the landscape showed,\n\r\n        It was a wretched plain;\n\n\n\r\n    Where mounds of rubbish, ugly pits,\n\r\n        And brick-fields scarred the globe;\n\r\n    Those wastes where desolation sits\n\r\n        Without her ancient robe.\n\n\n\r\n    A drizzling rain proclaimed the skies\n\r\n        As wretched as the earth;\n\r\n    I wandered on, and weary sighs\n\r\n        Were all my lot was worth.\n\n\n\r\n    When sudden, as I turned my way,\n\r\n        Burst in the ocean-waves:\n\r\n    And lo! a blue wild-dancing bay\n\r\n        Fantastic rocks and caves!\n\n\n\r\n    I wept with joy. Ah! sometimes so,\n\r\n        In common daylight grief,\n\r\n    A beauty to the heart will go,\n\r\n        And bring the heart relief.\n\n\n\r\n    And, wandering, reft of hope or friend,\n\r\n        If such a thing should be,\n\r\n    One day we take the downward bend,\n\r\n        And lo, Eternity!\n\n\n\r\n    I wept with joy, delicious tears,\n\r\n        Which dreams alone bestow;\n\r\n    Until, mayhap, from out the years\n\r\n        We sleep, and further go.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    6.\n\n\n\r\n    Now I will mould a dream, awake,\n\r\n        Which I, asleep, would dream;\n\r\n    From all the forms of fancy take\n\r\n        One that shall also seem;\n\r\n    Seem in my verse (if not my brain),\n\r\n        Which sometimes may rejoice\n\r\n    In airy forms of Fancy's train,\n\r\n        Though nobler are my choice.\n\n\n\r\n    Some truth o'er all the land may lie\n\r\n        In children's dreams at night;\n\r\n    \nThey\n do not build the charmed sky\n\r\n        That domes them with delight.\n\r\n    And o'er the years that follow soon,\n\r\n        So all unlike the dreams,\n\r\n    Wander their odours, gleams their moon,\n\r\n        And flow their winds and streams.\n\n\n\r\n    Now I would dream that I awake\n\r\n        In scent of cool night air,\n\r\n    Above me star-clouds close and break;\n\r\n        Beneath--where am I, where?\n\r\n    A strange delight pervades my breast,\n\r\n        Of ancient pictures dim,\n\r\n    Where fair forms on the waters rest,\n\r\n        Or in the breezes swim.\n\n\n\r\n    I rest on arms as soft as strong,\n\r\n        Great arms of woman-mould;\n\r\n    My head is pillowed whence a song,\n\r\n        In many a rippling fold,\n\r\n    O'erfloods me from its bubbling spring:\n\r\n        A Titan goddess bears\n\r\n    Me, floating on her unseen wing,\n\r\n        Through gracious midnight airs.\n\n\n\r\n    And I am borne o'er sleeping seas,\n\r\n        O'er murmuring ears of corn,\n\r\n    Over the billowy tops of trees,\n\r\n        O'er roses pale till morn.\n\r\n    Over the lake--ah! nearer float,\n\r\n        Down on the water's breast;\n\r\n    Let me look deep, and gazing doat\n\r\n        On that white lily's nest.\n\n\n\r\n    The harebell's bed, as o'er we pass,\n\r\n        Swings all its bells about;\n\r\n    From waving blades of polished grass,\n\r\n        Flash moony splendours out.\n\r\n    Old homes we brush in wooded glades;\n\r\n        No eyes at windows shine;\n\r\n    For all true men and noble maids\n\r\n        Are out in dreams like mine.\n\n\n\r\n    And foam-bell-kisses drift and break\n\r\n        From wind-waves of the South\n\r\n    Against my brow and eyes awake,\n\r\n        And yet I see no mouth.\n\r\n    Light laughter ripples down the air,\n\r\n        Light sighs float up below;\n\r\n    And o'er me ever, radiant pair,\n\r\n        The Queen's great star-eyes go.\n\n\n\r\n    And motion like a dreaming wave\n\r\n        Wafts me in gladness dim\n\r\n    Through air just cool enough to lave\n\r\n        With sense each conscious limb.\n\r\n    But ah! the dream eludes the rhyme,\n\r\n        As dreams break free from sleep;\n\r\n    The dream will keep its own free time,\n\r\n        In mazy float or sweep.\n\n\n\r\n    And thought too keen for joy awakes,\n\r\n        As on the horizon far,\n\r\n    A dead pale light the circle breaks,\n\r\n        But not a dawning star.\n\r\n    No, there I cannot, dare not go;\n\r\n        Pale women wander there;\n\r\n    With cold fire murderous eyeballs glow;\n\r\n        And children see despair.\n\n\n\r\n    The joy has lost its dreamy zest;\n\r\n        I feel a pang of loss;\n\r\n    My wandering hand o'er mounds of rest\n\r\n        Finds only mounds of moss.\n\r\n    Beneath the bare night-stars I lie;\n\r\n        Cold winds are moaning past:\n\r\n    Alas! the earth with grief will die,\n\r\n        The great earth is aghast.\n\n\n\r\n    I look above--there dawns no face;\n\r\n        Around--no footsteps come;\n\r\n    No voice inhabits this great space;\n\r\n        God knows, but keepeth dumb.\n\r\n    I wake, and know that God is by,\n\r\n        And more than dreams will give;\n\r\n    And that the hearts that moan and die,\n\r\n        Shall yet awake and live."}

The master came\n\r\n        In his old woven dress;\n\r\n    I stood in joy, and yet in shame,\n\r\n        Oppressed with earthliness.\n\n\n\r\n    He stretched his arms, and gently sought\n\r\n        To clasp me to his soul;\n\r\n    I shrunk away, because I thought\n\r\n        He did not know the whole.\n\n\n\r\n    I did not love him as I would,\n\r\n        Embraces were not meet;\n\r\n    I sank before him where he stood,\n\r\n        And held and kissed his feet.\n\n\n\r\n    Ten years have passed away since then,\n\r\n        Oft hast thou come to me;\n\r\n    The question scarce will rise again,\n\r\n        Whether I care for thee.\n\n\n\r\n    To every doubt, in thee my heart\n\r\n        An answer hopes to find;\n\r\n    In every gladness, Lord, thou art,\n\r\n        The deeper joy behind.\n\n\n\r\n    And yet in other realms of life,\n\r\n        Unknown temptations rise,\n\r\n    Unknown perplexities and strife,\n\r\n        New questions and replies.\n\n\n\r\n    And every lesson learnt, anew,\n\r\n        The vain assurance lends\n\r\n    That now I know, and now can do,\n\r\n        And now should see thy ends.\n\n\n\r\n    So I forget I am a child,\n\r\n        And act as if a man;\n\r\n    Who through the dark and tempest wild\n\r\n        Will go, because he can.\n\n\n\r\n    And so, O Lord, not yet I dare\n\r\n        To clasp thee to my breast;\n\r\n    Though well I know that only there\n\r\n        Is hid the secret rest.\n\n\n\r\n    And yet I shrink not, as at first:\n\r\n        Be thou the judge of guilt;\n\r\n    Thou knowest all my best and worst,\n\r\n        Do with me as thou wilt.\n\n\n\r\n    Spread thou once more thine arms abroad,\n\r\n        Lay bare thy bosom's beat;\n\r\n    Thou shalt embrace me, O my God,\n\r\n        And I will kiss thy feet.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    2.\n\n\n\r\n    I stood before my childhood's home,\n\r\n        Outside the belt of trees;\n\r\n    All round, my dreaming glances roam\n\r\n        On well-known hills and leas.\n\n\n\r\n    When sudden, from the westward, rushed\n\r\n        A wide array of waves;\n\r\n    Over the subject fields they gushed\n\r\n        From far-off, unknown caves.\n\n\n\r\n    And up the hill they clomb and came,\n\r\n        On flowing like a sea:\n\r\n    I saw, and watched them like a game;\n\r\n        No terror woke in me.\n\n\n\r\n    For just the belting trees within,\n\r\n        I saw my father wait;\n\r\n    And should the waves the summit win,\n\r\n        I would go through the gate.\n\n\n\r\n    For by his side all doubt was dumb,\n\r\n        And terror ceased to foam;\n\r\n    No great sea-billows dared to come,\n\r\n        And tread the holy home.\n\n\n\r\n    Two days passed by. With restless toss,\n\r\n        The red flood brake its doors;\n\r\n    Prostrate I lay, and looked across\n\r\n        To the eternal shores.\n\n\n\r\n    The world was fair, and hope was nigh,\n\r\n        Some men and women true;\n\r\n    And I was strong, and Death and I\n\r\n        Would have a hard ado.\n\n\n\r\n    And so I shrank. But sweet and good\n\r\n        The dream came to my aid;\n\r\n    Within the trees my father stood,\n\r\n        I must not be dismayed.\n\n\n\r\n    My grief was his, not mine alone;\n\r\n        The waves that burst in fears,\n\r\n    He heard not only with his own,\n\r\n        But heard them with my ears.\n\n\n\r\n    My life and death belong to thee,\n\r\n        For I am thine, O God;\n\r\n    Thy hands have made and fashioned me,\n\r\n        'Tis thine to bear the load.\n\n\n\r\n    And thou shalt bear it. I will try\n\r\n        To be a peaceful child,\n\r\n    Whom in thy arms right tenderly\n\r\n        Thou carriest through the wild.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    3.\n\n\n\r\n    The rich man mourns his little loss,\n\r\n        And knits the brow of care;\n\r\n    The poor man tries to bear the cross,\n\r\n        And seeks relief in prayer.\n\n\n\r\n    Some gold had vanished from my purse,\n\r\n        Which I had watched but ill;\n\r\n    I feared a lack, but feared yet worse\n\r\n        Regret returning still.\n\n\n\r\n    And so I knelt and prayed my prayer\n\r\n        To Him who maketh strong,\n\r\n    That no returning thoughts of care\n\r\n        Should do my spirit wrong.\n\n\n\r\n    I rose in peace, in comfort went,\n\r\n        And laid me down to rest;\n\r\n    But straight my soul grew confident\n\r\n        With gladness of the blest.\n\n\n\r\n    For ere the sleep that care redeems,\n\r\n        My soul such visions had,\n\r\n    That never child in childhood's dreams\n\r\n        Was more exulting glad.\n\n\n\r\n    No white-robed angels floated by\n\r\n        On slow, reposing wings;\n\r\n    I only saw, with inward eye,\n\r\n        Some very common things.\n\n\n\r\n    First rose the scarlet pimpernel,\n\r\n        With burning purple heart;\n\r\n    I saw it, and I knew right well\n\r\n        The lesson of its art.\n\n\n\r\n    Then came the primrose, childlike flower;\n\r\n        It looked me in the face;\n\r\n    It bore a message full of power,\n\r\n        And confidence, and grace.\n\n\n\r\n    And winds arose on uplands wild,\n\r\n        And bathed me like a stream;\n\r\n    And sheep-bells babbled round the child\n\r\n        Who loved them in a dream.\n\n\n\r\n    Henceforth my mind was never crossed\n\r\n        By thought of vanished gold,\n\r\n    But with it came the guardian host\n\r\n        Of flowers both meek and bold.\n\n\n\r\n    The loss is riches while I live,\n\r\n        A joy I would not lose:\n\r\n    Choose ever, God, what Thou wilt give,\n\r\n        Not leaving me to choose.\n\n\n\r\n    \n\"What said the flowers in whisper low,\n\r\n        To soothe me into rest?\"\n\r\n    I scarce have words--they seemed to grow\n\r\n        Right out of God's own breast.\n\n\n\r\n    They said, God meant the flowers He made,\n\r\n        As children see the same;\n\r\n    They said the words the lilies said\n\r\n        When Jesus looked at them.\n\n\n\r\n    And if you want to hear the flowers\n\r\n        Speak ancient words, all new,\n\r\n    They may, if you, in darksome hours,\n\r\n        Ask God to comfort you.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    4.\n\n\n\r\n    Our souls, in daylight hours, awake,\n\r\n        With visions sometimes teem,\n\r\n    Which to the slumbering brain would take\n\r\n        The form of wondrous dream.\n\n\n\r\n    Thus, once, I saw a level space,\n\r\n        With circling mountains nigh;\n\r\n    And round it grouped all forms of grace,\n\r\n        A goodly company.\n\n\n\r\n    And at one end, with gentle rise,\n\r\n        Stood something like a throne;\n\r\n    And thither all the radiant eyes,\n\r\n        As to a centre, shone.\n\n\n\r\n    And on the seat the noblest form\n\r\n        Of glory, dim-descried;\n\r\n    His glance would quell all passion-storm,\n\r\n        All doubt, and fear, and pride.\n\n\n\r\n    But lo! his eyes far-fixed burn\n\r\n        Adown the widening vale;\n\r\n    The looks of all obedient turn,\n\r\n        And soon those looks are pale.\n\n\n\r\n    For, through the shining multitude,\n\r\n        With feeble step and slow,\n\r\n    A weary man, in garments rude,\n\r\n        All falteringly did go.\n\n\n\r\n    His face was white, and still-composed,\n\r\n        Like one that had been dead;\n\r\n    The eyes, from eyelids half unclosed,\n\r\n        A faint, wan splendour shed.\n\n\n\r\n    And to his brow a strange wreath clung,\n\r\n        And drops of crimson hue;\n\r\n    And his rough hands, oh, sadly wrung!\n\r\n        Were pierced through and through.\n\n\n\r\n    And not a look he turned aside;\n\r\n        His eyes were forward bent;\n\r\n    And slow the eyelids opened wide,\n\r\n        As towards the throne he went.\n\n\n\r\n    At length he reached the mighty throne,\n\r\n        And sank upon his knees;\n\r\n    And clasped his hands with stifled groan,\n\r\n        And spake in words like these:--\n\n\n\r\n    \"Father, I am come back--Thy will\n\r\n        Is sometimes hard to do.\"\n\r\n    From all the multitude so still,\n\r\n        A sound of weeping grew.\n\n\n\r\n    And mournful-glad came down the One,\n\r\n        And kneeled, and clasped His child;\n\r\n    Sank on His breast the outworn man,\n\r\n        And wept until he smiled.\n\n\n\r\n    And when their tears had stilled their sighs,\n\r\n        And joy their tears had dried,\n\r\n    The people saw, with lifted eyes,\n\r\n        Them seated side by side.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    5.\n\n\n\r\n    I lay and dreamed. Three crosses stood\n\r\n        Amid the gloomy air.\n\r\n    Two bore two men--one was the Good;\n\r\n        The third rose waiting, bare.\n\n\n\r\n    A Roman soldier, coming by,\n\r\n        Mistook me for the third;\n\r\n    I lifted up my asking eye\n\r\n        For Jesus' sign or word.\n\n\n\r\n    I thought He signed that I should yield,\n\r\n        And give the error way.\n\r\n    I held my peace; no word revealed,\n\r\n        No gesture uttered \nnay.\n\n\n\r\n    Against the cross a scaffold stood,\n\r\n        Whence easy hands could nail\n\r\n    The doomed upon that altar-wood,\n\r\n        Whose fire burns slow and pale.\n\n\n\r\n    Upon this ledge he lifted me.\n\r\n        I stood all thoughtful there,\n\r\n    Waiting until the deadly tree\n\r\n        My form for fruit should bear.\n\n\n\r\n    Rose up the waves of fear and doubt,\n\r\n        Rose up from heart to brain;\n\r\n    They shut the world of vision out,\n\r\n        And thus they cried amain:\n\n\n\r\n    \"Ah me! my hands--the hammer's knock--\n\r\n        The nails--the tearing strength!\"\n\r\n    My soul replied: \"'Tis but a shock,\n\r\n        That grows to pain at length.\"\n\n\n\r\n    \"Ah me! the awful fight with death;\n\r\n        The hours to hang and die;\n\r\n    The thirsting gasp for common breath,\n\r\n        That passes heedless by!\"\n\n\n\r\n    My soul replied: \"A faintness soon\n\r\n        Will shroud thee in its fold;\n\r\n    The hours will go,--the fearful noon\n\r\n        Rise, pass--and thou art cold.\n\n\n\r\n    \"And for thy suffering, what to thee\n\r\n        Is that? or care of thine?\n\r\n    Thou living branch upon the tree\n\r\n        Whose root is the Divine!\n\n\n\r\n    \"'Tis His to care that thou endure;\n\r\n        That pain shall grow or fade;\n\r\n    With bleeding hands hang on thy cure,\n\r\n        He knows what He hath made.\"\n\n\n\r\n    And still, for all the inward wail,\n\r\n        My foot was firmly pressed;\n\r\n    For still the fear lest I should fail\n\r\n        Was stronger than the rest.\n\n\n\r\n    And thus I stood, until the strife\n\r\n        The bonds of slumber brake;\n\r\n    I felt as I had ruined life,\n\r\n        Had fled, and come awake.\n\n\n\r\n    Yet I was glad, my heart confessed,\n\r\n        The trial went not on;\n\r\n    Glad likewise I had stood the test,\n\r\n        As far as it had gone.\n\n\n\r\n    And yet I fear some recreant thought,\n\r\n        Which now I all forget,\n\r\n    That painful feeling in me wrought\n\r\n        Of failure, lingering yet.\n\n\n\r\n    And if the dream had had its scope,\n\r\n        I might have fled the field;\n\r\n    But yet I thank Thee for the hope,\n\r\n        And think I dared not yield.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    6.\n\n\n\r\n    Methinks I hear, as I lie slowly dying,\n\r\n        Indulgent friends say, weeping, \"\nHe was good.\n\"\n\r\n    I fail to speak, a faint denial trying,--\n\r\n        They answer, \"\nHis humility withstood.\n\"\n\n\n\r\n    I, knowing better, part with love unspoken;\n\r\n        And find the unknown world not all unknown.\n\r\n    The bonds that held me from my centre broken,\n\r\n        I seek my home, the Saviour's homely throne.\n\n\n\r\n    How He will greet me, I walk on and wonder;\n\r\n        And think I know what I will say to Him.\n\r\n    I fear no sapphire floor of cloudy thunder,\n\r\n        I fear no passing vision great and dim.\n\n\n\r\n    But He knows all my unknown weary story:\n\r\n        How will He judge me, pure, and good, and fair?\n\r\n    I come to Him in all His conquered glory,\n\r\n        Won from such life as I went dreaming there!\n\n\n\r\n    I come; I fall before Him, faintly saying:\n\r\n        \"Ah, Lord, shall I thy loving favour win?\n\r\n    Earth's beauties tempted me; my walk was straying--\n\r\n        I have no honour--but may I come in?\"\n\n\n\r\n    \"I know thee well.

sea-maids sent\n\r\n        Over the billows hoar.\n\n\n\r\n    For in a wave-worn rock I lie;\n\r\n        Outside, the waters foam;\n\r\n    And echoes of old storms go by\n\r\n        Within my sea-built dome.\n\r\n    The waters, half the gloomy way,\n\r\n        Beneath its arches come;\n\r\n    Throbbing to unseen billows' play,\n\r\n        The green gulfs waver dumb.\n\n\n\r\n    A dawning twilight through the cave\n\r\n        In moony gleams doth go,\n\r\n    Half from the swan above the wave,\n\r\n        Half from the swan below.\n\r\n    Close to my feet she gently drifts,\n\r\n        Among the glistening things;\n\r\n    She stoops her crowny head, and lifts\n\r\n        White shoulders of her wings.\n\n\n\r\n    Oh! earth is rich with many a

white as they;\n\r\n    If others hear, of other kinds,\n\r\n        I wish them far away.\n\n\n\r\n    Upon the neck, between the wings,\n\r\n        Of a white, sailing swan,\n\r\n    A flaky bed of shelterings--\n\r\n        There you will find the one.\n\r\n    The other--well, it will not out,\n\r\n        Nor need I tell it you;\n\r\n    I've told you one, and need you doubt,\n\r\n        When there are only two?\n\n\n\r\n    Fulfil old dreams, O splendid bird,\n\r\n        Me o'er the waters bear;\n\r\n    Sure never ocean's face was stirred\n\r\n        By any

short flutter of each wing\n\r\n        Half-spread, and stooping crown,\n\r\n    She calls me; and with one glad spring\n\r\n        I nestle in the down.\n\r\n    Plunges the bark, then bounds aloft,\n\r\n        With lessening dip and rise.\n\r\n    Round curves her neck with motion soft--\n\r\n        Sure those are woman's eyes.\n\n\n\r\n    One stroke unseen, with oary feet,\n\r\n        One stroke--away she sweeps;\n\r\n    Over the waters pale we fleet,\n\r\n        Suspended in the deeps.\n\r\n    And round the sheltering rock, and lo!\n\r\n        The tumbling, weltering sea!\n\r\n    On to the west, away we go,\n\r\n     Over the waters free!\n\n\n\r\n    Her motions moulded to the wave,\n\r\n        Her billowy neck thrown back,\n\r\n    With slow strong pulse, stately and grave,\n\r\n        She cleaves a rippling track.\n\r\n    And up the mounting wave we glide,\n\r\n        With climbing sweeping blow;\n\r\n    And down the steep, far-sloping side,\n\r\n        To flowing vales below.\n\n\n\r\n    I hear the murmur of the deep\n\r\n        In countless ripples pass,\n\r\n    Like talking children in their sleep,\n\r\n        Like winds in reedy grass.\n\r\n    And through some ruffled feathers, I\n\r\n        The glassy rolling mark,\n\r\n    With which the waves eternally\n\r\n        Roll on from dawn to dark.\n\n\n\r\n    The night is blue, the stars aglow;\n\r\n        In solemn peace o'erhead\n\r\n    The archless depth of heaven; below,\n\r\n        The murmuring, heaving bed.\n\r\n    A thickened night, it heaveth on,\n\r\n        A fallen earthly sky;\n\r\n    The shadows of its stars alone\n\r\n        Are left to know it by.\n\n\n\r\n    What faints across the lifted loop\n\r\n     Of cloud-veil upward cast?\n\r\n    With sea-veiled limbs, a sleeping group\n\r\n        Of Nereids dreaming past.\n\r\n    Swim on, my boat; who knows but I,\n\r\n        Ere night sinks to her grave,\n\r\n    May see in splendour pale float by\n\r\n        The Venus of the wave?\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    2.\n\n\n\r\n    In the night, round a lady dreaming--\n\r\n        A queen among the dreams--\n\r\n    Came the silent sunset streaming,\n\r\n        Mixed with the voice of streams.\n\r\n    A silver fountain springing\n\r\n        Blossoms in molten gold;\n\r\n    And the airs of the birds float ringing\n\r\n        Through harmonies manifold.\n\n\n\r\n    She lies in a watered valley;\n\r\n        Her garden melts away\n\r\n    Through foot-path and curving alley\n\r\n        Into the wild wood grey.\n\r\n    And the green of the vale goes creeping\n\r\n        To the feet of the rugged hills,\n\r\n    Where the moveless rocks are keeping\n\r\n        The homes of the wandering rills.\n\n\n\r\n    And the hues of the flowers grow deeper,\n\r\n        Till they dye her very brain;\n\r\n    And their scents, like the soul of a sleeper,\n\r\n        Wander and waver and rain.\n\r\n    For dreams have a wealth of glory\n\r\n        That daylight cannot give:\n\r\n    Ah God! make the hope a story--\n\r\n        Bid the dreams arise and live.\n\n\n\r\n    She lay and gazed at the flowers,\n\r\n        Till her soul's own garden smiled\n\r\n    With blossom-o'ershaded bowers,\n\r\n        Great colours and splendours wild.\n\r\n    And her heart filled up with gladness,\n\r\n        Till it could only ache;\n\r\n    And it turned aside to sadness,\n\r\n        As if for pity's sake.\n\n\n\r\n    And a fog came o'er the meadows,\n\r\n        And the rich hues fainting lay;\n\r\n    Came from the woods the shadows,\n\r\n        Came from the rocks the grey.\n\r\n    And the sunset thither had vanished,\n\r\n        Where the sunsets always go;\n\r\n    And the sounds of the stream were banished,\n\r\n        As if slain by frost and snow.\n\n\n\r\n    And the flowers paled fast and faster,\n\r\n        And they crumbled fold on fold,\n\r\n    Till they looked like the stained plaster\n\r\n        Of a cornice in ruin old.\n\r\n    And they blackened and shrunk together,\n\r\n        As if scorched by the breath of flame,\n\r\n    With a sad perplexity whether\n\r\n        They were or were not the same.\n\n\n\r\n    And she saw herself still lying,\n\r\n        And smiling on, the while;\n\r\n    And the smile, instead of dying,\n\r\n        Was fixed in an idiot smile.\n\r\n    And the lady arose in sorrow\n\r\n        Out of her sleep's dark stream;\n\r\n    But her dream made dark the morrow,\n\r\n        And she told me the haunting dream.\n\n\n\r\n    Alas! dear lady, I know it,\n\r\n        The dream that all is a dream;\n\r\n    The joy with the doubt below it\n\r\n        That the bright things only seem.\n\r\n    One moment of sad commotion,\n\r\n        And one of doubt's withering rule--\n\r\n    And the great wave-pulsing ocean\n\r\n        Is only a gathered pool.\n\n\n\r\n    And the flowers are spots of painting,\n\r\n        Of lifeless staring hue;\n\r\n    Though your heart is sick to fainting,\n\r\n        They say not a word to you.\n\r\n    And the birds know nought of gladness,\n\r\n        They are only song-machines;\n\r\n    And a man is a skilful madness,\n\r\n        And the women pictured queens.\n\n\n\r\n    And fiercely we dig the fountain,\n\r\n        To know the water true;\n\r\n    And we climb the crest of the mountain,\n\r\n        To part it from the blue.\n\r\n    But we look too far before us\n\r\n        For that which is more than nigh;\n\r\n    Though the sky is lofty o'er us,\n\r\n        We are always in the sky.\n\n\n\r\n    And the fog, o'er the roses that creepeth,\n\r\n        Steams from the unknown sea,\n\r\n    In the dark of the soul that sleepeth,\n\r\n        And sigheth constantly,\n\r\n    Because o'er the face of its waters\n\r\n        The breathing hath not gone;\n\r\n    And instead of glad sons and daughters,\n\r\n        Wild things are moaning on.\n\n\n\r\n    When the heart knows well the Father,\n\r\n        The eyes will be always day;\n\r\n    But now they grow dim the rather\n\r\n        That the light is more than they.\n\r\n    Believe, amidst thy sorrows,\n\r\n        That the blight that swathes the earth\n\r\n    Is only a shade that borrows\n\r\n        Life from thy spirit's dearth.\n\n\n\r\n    God's heart is the fount of beauty;\n\r\n        Thy heart is its visible well;\n\r\n    If it vanish, do thou thy duty,\n\r\n        That necromantic spell;\n\r\n    And thy heart to the Father crying\n\r\n        Will fill with waters deep;\n\r\n    Thine eyes may say, \nBeauty is dying;\n\r\n        But thy spirit, \nShe goes to sleep.\n\n\n\r\n    And I fear not, thy fair soul ever\n\r\n        Will smile as thy image smiled;\n\r\n    It had fled with a sudden shiver,\n\r\n        And thy body lay beguiled.\n\r\n    Let the flowers and thy beauty perish;\n\r\n        Let them go to the ancient dust.\n\r\n    But the hopes that the children cherish,\n\r\n        They are the Father's trust.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    3.\n\n\n\r\n    A great church in an empty square,\n\r\n        A place of echoing tones;\n\r\n    Feet pass not oft enough to wear\n\r\n        The grass between the stones.\n\n\n\r\n    The jarring sounds that haunt its gates,\n\r\n        Like distant thunders boom;\n\r\n    The boding heart half-listening waits,\n\r\n        As for a coming doom.\n\n\n\r\n    The door stands wide, the church is bare,\n\r\n        Oh, horror, ghastly, sore!\n\r\n    A gulf of death, with hideous stare,\n\r\n        Yawns in the earthen floor;\n\n\n\r\n    As if the ground had sunk away\n\r\n        Into a void below:\n\r\n    Its shapeless sides of dark-hued clay\n\r\n        Hang ready aye to go.\n\n\n\r\n    I am myself a horrid grave,\n\r\n        My very heart turns grey;\n\r\n    This charnel-hole,--will no one save\n\r\n        And force my feet away?\n\n\n\r\n    The changing dead are there, I know,\n\r\n        In terror ever new;\n\r\n    Yet down the frightful slope I go,\n\r\n        That downward goeth too.\n\n\n\r\n    Beneath the caverned floor I hie,\n\r\n        And seem, with anguish dull,\n\r\n    To enter by the empty eye\n\r\n        Into a monstrous skull.\n\n\n\r\n    Stumbling on what I dare not guess,\n\r\n        And wading through the gloom,\n\r\n    Less deep the shades my eyes oppress,\n\r\n        I see the awful tomb.\n\n\n\r\n    My steps have led me to a door,\n\r\n        With iron clenched and barred;\n\r\n    Grim Death hides there a ghastlier store,\n\r\n        Great spider in his ward.\n\n\n\r\n    The portals shake, the bars are bowed,\n\r\n        As if an earthy wind\n\r\n    That never bore a leaf or cloud\n\r\n        Were pressing hard behind.\n\n\n\r\n    They shake, they groan, they outward strain.\n\r\n        What sight, of dire dismay\n\r\n    Will freeze its form upon my brain,\n\r\n        And turn it into clay?\n\n\n\r\n    They shake, they groan, they bend, they crack;\n\r\n        The bars, the doors divide:\n\r\n    A flood of glory at their back\n\r\n        Hath burst the portals wide.\n\n\n\r\n    Flows in the light of vanished days,\n\r\n        The joy of long-set moons;\n\r\n    The flood of radiance billowy plays,\n\r\n        In sweet-conflicting tunes.\n\n\n\r\n    The gulf is filled with flashing tides,\n\r\n        An awful gulf no more;\n\r\n    A maze of ferns clothes all its sides,\n\r\n        Of mosses all its floor.\n\n\n\r\n    And, floating through the streams, appear\n\r\n        Such forms of beauty rare,\n\r\n    As every aim at beauty here\n\r\n        Had found its \nwould be\n there.\n\n\n\r\n    I said: 'Tis well no hand came nigh,\n\r\n        To turn my steps astray;\n\r\n    'Tis good we cannot choose but die,\n\r\n        That life may have its way.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    4.\n\n\n\r\n    Before I sleep, some dreams draw nigh,\n\r\n        Which are not fancy mere;\n\r\n    For sudden lights an inward eye,\n\r\n        And wondrous things appear.\n\n\n\r\n    Thus, unawares, with vision wide,\n\r\n        A steep hill once I saw,\n\r\n    In faint dream lights, which ever hide\n\r\n        Their fountain and their law.\n\n\n\r\n    And up and down the hill reclined\n\r\n        A host of statues old;\n\r\n    Such wondrous forms as you might find\n\r\n        Deep under ancient mould.\n\n\n\r\n    They lay, wild scattered, all along,\n\r\n        And maimed as if in fight;\n\r\n    But every one of all the throng\n\r\n        Was precious to the sight.\n\n\n\r\n    Betwixt the night and hill they ranged,\n\r\n        In dead composure cast.\n\r\n    As suddenly the dream was changed,\n\r\n        And all the wonder past.\n\n\n\r\n    The hill remained; but what it bore\n\r\n        Was broken reedy stalks,\n\r\n    Bent hither, thither, drooping o'er,\n\r\n        Like flowers o'er weedy walks.\n\n\n\r\n    For each dim form of marble rare,\n\r\n        Bent a wind-broken reed;\n\r\n    So hangs on autumn-field, long-bare,\n\r\n     Some tall and straggling weed.\n\n\n\r\n    The autumn night hung like a pall,\n\r\n        Hung mournfully and dead;\n\r\n    And if a wind had waked at all,\n\r\n        It had but moaned and fled.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    5.\n\n\n\r\n    I lay and dreamed. Of thought and sleep\n\r\n        Was born a heavenly joy:\n\r\n    I dreamed of two who always keep\n\r\n        Me happy as a boy.\n\n\n\r\n    I was with them. My heart-bells rung\n\r\n        With joy my heart above;\n\r\n    Their present heaven my earth o'erhung,\n\r\n        And earth was glad with love.\n\n\n\r\n    The dream grew troubled. Crowds went on,\n\r\n        And sought their varied ends;\n\r\n    Till stream on stream, the crowds had gone,\n\r\n        And swept away my friends.\n\n\n\r\n    I was alone. A miry road\n\r\n        I followed, all in vain;\n\r\n    No well-known hill the landscape showed,\n\r\n        It was a wretched plain;\n\n\n\r\n    Where mounds of rubbish, ugly pits,\n\r\n        And brick-fields scarred the globe;\n\r\n    Those wastes where desolation sits\n\r\n        Without her ancient robe.\n\n\n\r\n    A drizzling rain proclaimed the skies\n\r\n        As wretched as the earth;\n\r\n    I wandered on, and weary sighs\n\r\n        Were all my lot was worth.\n\n\n\r\n    When sudden, as I turned my way,\n\r\n        Burst in the ocean-waves:\n\r\n    And lo! a blue wild-dancing bay\n\r\n        Fantastic rocks and caves!\n\n\n\r\n    I wept with joy. Ah! sometimes so,\n\r\n        In common daylight grief,\n\r\n    A beauty to the heart will go,\n\r\n        And bring the heart relief.\n\n\n\r\n    And, wandering, reft of hope or friend,\n\r\n        If such a thing should be,\n\r\n    One day we take the downward bend,\n\r\n        And lo, Eternity!\n\n\n\r\n    I wept with joy, delicious tears,\n\r\n        Which dreams alone bestow;\n\r\n    Until, mayhap, from out the years\n\r\n        We sleep, and further go.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    6.\n\n\n\r\n    Now I will mould a dream, awake,\n\r\n        Which I, asleep, would dream;\n\r\n    From all the forms of fancy take\n\r\n        One that shall also seem;\n\r\n    Seem in my verse (if not my brain),\n\r\n        Which sometimes may rejoice\n\r\n    In airy forms of Fancy's train,\n\r\n        Though nobler are my choice.\n\n\n\r\n    Some truth o'er all the land may lie\n\r\n        In children's dreams at night;\n\r\n    \nThey\n do not build the charmed sky\n\r\n        That domes them with delight.\n\r\n    And o'er the years that follow soon,\n\r\n        So all unlike the dreams,\n\r\n    Wander their odours, gleams their moon,\n\r\n        And flow their winds and streams.\n\n\n\r\n    Now I would dream that I awake\n\r\n        In scent of cool night air,\n\r\n    Above me star-clouds close and break;\n\r\n        Beneath--where am I, where?\n\r\n    A strange delight pervades my breast,\n\r\n        Of ancient pictures dim,\n\r\n    Where fair forms on the waters rest,\n\r\n        Or in the breezes swim.\n\n\n\r\n    I rest on arms as soft as strong,\n\r\n        Great arms of woman-mould;\n\r\n    My head is pillowed whence a song,\n\r\n        In many a rippling fold,\n\r\n    O'erfloods me from its bubbling spring:\n\r\n        A Titan goddess bears\n\r\n    Me, floating on her unseen wing,\n\r\n        Through gracious midnight airs.\n\n\n\r\n    And I am borne o'er sleeping seas,\n\r\n        O'er murmuring ears of corn,\n\r\n    Over the billowy tops of trees,\n\r\n        O'er roses pale till morn.\n\r\n    Over the lake--ah! nearer float,\n\r\n        Down on the water's breast;\n\r\n    Let me look deep, and gazing doat\n\r\n        On that white lily's nest.\n\n\n\r\n    The harebell's bed, as o'er we pass,\n\r\n        Swings all its bells about;\n\r\n    From waving blades of polished grass,\n\r\n        Flash moony splendours out.\n\r\n    Old homes we brush in wooded glades;\n\r\n        No eyes at windows shine;\n\r\n    For all true men and noble maids\n\r\n        Are out in dreams like mine.\n\n\n\r\n    And foam-bell-kisses drift and break\n\r\n        From wind-waves of the South\n\r\n    Against my brow and eyes awake,\n\r\n        And yet I see no mouth.\n\r\n    Light laughter ripples down the air,\n\r\n        Light sighs float up below;\n\r\n    And o'er me ever, radiant pair,\n\r\n        The Queen's great star-eyes go.\n\n\n\r\n    And motion like a dreaming wave\n\r\n        Wafts me in gladness dim\n\r\n    Through air just cool enough to lave\n\r\n        With sense each conscious limb.\n\r\n    But ah! the dream eludes the rhyme,\n\r\n        As dreams break free from sleep;\n\r\n    The dream will keep its own free time,\n\r\n        In mazy float or sweep.\n\n\n\r\n    And thought too keen for joy awakes,\n\r\n        As on the horizon far,\n\r\n    A dead pale light the circle breaks,\n\r\n        But not a dawning star.\n\r\n    No, there I cannot, dare not go;\n\r\n        Pale women wander there;\n\r\n    With cold fire murderous eyeballs glow;\n\r\n        And children see despair.\n\n\n\r\n    The joy has lost its dreamy zest;\n\r\n        I feel a pang of loss;\n\r\n    My wandering hand o'er mounds of rest\n\r\n        Finds only mounds of moss.\n\r\n    Beneath the bare night-stars I lie;\n\r\n        Cold winds are moaning past:\n\r\n    Alas! the earth with grief will die,\n\r\n        The great earth is aghast.\n\n\n\r\n    I look above--there dawns no face;\n\r\n        Around--no footsteps come;\n\r\n    No voice inhabits this great space;\n\r\n        God knows, but keepeth dumb.\n\r\n    I wake, and know that God is by,\n\r\n        And more than dreams will give;\n\r\n    And that the hearts that moan and die,\n\r\n        Shall yet awake and live."}

as yet to dangers blind,\n\r\n    These conversations she was led to deem,\n\r\n    Mere friendly ways that raised sincere esteem;\n\r\n    And this alone she ardently desired,\n\r\n    Without supposing more would be required,\n\r\n    Or any thing improper be the case:\n\r\n    She'd rather die than suffer such disgrace.\n\r\n    'Twas difficult the business to commence;\n\r\n    A letter 's often lost, or gives offence,\n\r\n    And many serious accidents arrive:\n\r\n    To have a confidant 'twere better strive;\n\r\n    But where could such a female friend be found?\n\r\n    Gerontes dreaded was by all around.\n\r\n    I've said already, Cupid will obtain,\n\r\n    One way or t'other, what he wants to gain;\n\r\n    And this will show the observation just\n\r\n    The maxim's such as you may always trust.\n\n\n\r\n    A FEMALE relative young Cleon had,\n\r\n    A peevish prude, who looked upon the lad,\n\r\n    As one she had a right to rule and scold;\n\r\n    Her name was Mistress Alice: sour and old.\n\n\n\r\n    ONE summer's day, Aminta to her said:\n\r\n    I cannot think how 'tis, your cousin's led,\n\r\n    (Though quite indifferent he is to me,\n\r\n    And doubtless such will ever prove to be)\n\r\n    With various fond attentions, to pretend,\n\r\n    He loves me - much beyond a common friend.\n\r\n    My window oft he passes day and night;\n\r\n    I cannot move a step, but he's in sight,\n\r\n    And in a moment at my heels appears;\n\r\n    Notes, letters full of soft expressions, dears,\n\r\n    To me are sent by one I will not name,\n\r\n    For known to you, she would be thought to blame:\n\r\n    Pray put an end to such a wild pursuit\n\r\n    It nothing can produce but wretched fruit;\n\r\n    My husband may take fire at things like these;\n\r\n    And as to Cleon. - me he'll never please;\n\r\n    I'll thank you to inform him what I say;\n\r\n    Such steps are useless: folly they betray.\n\n\n\r\n    MUCH praise Aminta from the dame received;\n\r\n    Who promised that the conduct, which aggrieved;\n\r\n    To Cleon she would mention, as desired,\n\r\n    And reprimand him, as the fault required:\n\r\n    So well would scold him, that she might be sure,\n\r\n    From him in future she would be secure.\n\n\n\r\n    THE foll'wing day our youth to Alice came;\n\r\n    To pay a visit solely was his aim;\n\r\n    She told him what Aminta had declared,\n\r\n    And, in her lecture, words by no means spared.\n\r\n    The lad, surprised, on oath the whole denied,\n\r\n    And vowed to gain her love, he never tried.\n\r\n    Old Alice called her cousin, imp of Hell;\n\r\n    Said she, in all that's wicked, you excel;\n\r\n    You will not all your base designs confess;\n\r\n    The oaths are false on which you lay such stress,\n\r\n    And punishment most richly you deserve;\n\r\n    But false or true, from this I will not swerve,\n\r\n    That you should recollect, Aminta 's chaste,\n\r\n    And never will submit to be disgraced;\n\r\n    Renounce her from this hour; no more pursue: - \n\r\n    That easily, said Cleon, I can do;\n\r\n    Away he went: the case considered o'er;\n\r\n    But still the myst'ry he could not explore.\n\n\n\r\n    THREE days had scarcely passed: Aminta came,\n\r\n    To pay a visit to our ancient dame;\n\r\n    Cried she I fear, you have not seen as yet,\n\r\n    This youth, who worse and worse appears to get.\n\r\n    Rage, Mistress Alice, instantly o'erspread,\n\r\n    And ev'ry thing that's vile she of him said.\n\n\n\r\n    NO sooner had Aminta gone away,\n\r\n    But she for Cleon sent without delay.\n\r\n    He presently appeared; yet to detail\n\r\n    How Alice stormed, I certainly should fail;\n\r\n    Unless an iron tongue I could obtain:\n\r\n    All Hell was ransacked epithets to gain;\n\r\n    And Lucifer and Beelzebub were used:\n\r\n    No mortal ever was so much abused.\n\n\n\r\n    QUITE terrified, poor lad, he scarcely knew;\n\r\n    Her fury was so great, what best to do;\n\r\n    If he allowed that he had acted wrong,\n\r\n    'Twould wound his conscience and defile his tongue.\n\r\n    He home repaired, and turning in his mind\n\r\n    What he had heard, at length his thoughts inclined,\n\r\n    To fancy that Aminta was disposed,\n\r\n    To play some cunning trick, which, not disclosed,\n\r\n    Would operate to bring her wish about;\n\r\n    I see, said he, the scheme I should not doubt;\n\r\n    It surely is my duty kind to be:\n\r\n    Methinks I hear her freely say to me,\n\r\n    O Cleon! show affection, I am yours;\n\r\n    I love her too, for beauty that secures;\n\r\n    And while her seraph charms my bosom fire;\n\r\n    I equally the stratagem admire.\n\r\n    Most freely howsoe'er I will confess,\n\r\n    At first I was so dull, I could not guess\n\r\n    At what she aimed, but now the object's plain:\n\r\n    Aminta o'er my heart desires to reign.\n\n\n\r\n    THIS minute, if I durst, I'd thither go,\n\r\n    And, full of confidence, declare my woe,\n\r\n    The subtle flame that burns without controul;\n\r\n    What hurt to paint feelings of my soul?\n\r\n    From balance of accounts 'twill both exempt:\n\r\n    'Tis better far to love than show contempt.\n\r\n    But should the husband find me in the house? - \n\r\n    Ne'er think of that, and try the hunks to chouse.\n\n\n\r\n    THEIR course had hardly run three other days,\n\r\n    When fair Aminta, studious still of ways\n\r\n    To have her wish, again to Alice came,\n\r\n    To give dear Cleon notice of her flame.\n\r\n    My home, cried she, 'tis requisite I leave:\n\r\n    To ruin me, your cousin, I perceive,\n\r\n    Is still resolved, for presents now he sends;\n\r\n    But he mistakes, and blindly wealth expends;\n\r\n    I'm clearly not the woman he suspects:\n\r\n    See here, what jewels rare to please the sex!\n\r\n    Nice rubies, diamonds too, but what is more,\n\r\n    My portrait I have found among the store,\n\r\n    Which must have been from memory designed,\n\r\n    Since only with my husband that you'll find.\n\n\n\r\n    WHEN I arose, this person known to you,\n\r\n    Whose name I must conceal (to honour true),\n\r\n    Arrived and brought me what I just have shown;\n\r\n    The whole should at your cousin's head be thrown;\n\r\n    And were he present: - but I'll curb my rage;\n\r\n    Allow me to proceed, and you engage\n\r\n    To hear the rest: - he word has also sent,\n\r\n    That as to-day he knew my husband went\n\r\n    On business to his cottage in the wood,\n\r\n    Where he would sleep the night, he understood,\n\r\n    No sooner should the servants be in bed,\n\r\n    And Morpheus' robe be o'er their senses spread,\n\r\n    But to my dressing room he would repair: - \n\r\n    What can he hope, such project to declare?\n\r\n    A meeting place indeed! - he must be mad;\n\r\n    Were I not fearful 'twould affliction add\n\r\n    To my old husband, I would set a watch,\n\r\n    Who, at the entrance, should the villain catch;\n\r\n    Or put him instantly to shame and flight;\n\r\n    This said, she presently was out of sight.\n\n\n\r\n    AN hour had passed when Cleon came anew;\n\r\n    The jewels at him in a moment flew;\n\r\n    And scarcely Mistress Alice could refrain,\n\r\n    From wreaking further vengeance on the swain.\n\r\n    Is this your plan? cried she; but what is worse,\n\r\n    I find you still desire a greater curse;\n\r\n    And then she told him all Aminta said,\n\r\n    When last to visit her the fair was led.\n\n\n\r\n    HIMSELF most fully warned the youth now thought;\n\r\n    I loved, cried he, 'tis true; but that is naught,\n\r\n    Since nothing from the belle I must expect:\n\r\n    In future her completely I'll neglect.\n\r\n    That is the line, said Alice, you should take;\n\r\n    The lad howe'er was fully now awake,\n\r\n    And thoroughly resolved to seek the dame,\n\r\n    Whose cunning wiles had set him in a flame.\n\n\n\r\n    THE midnight hour the clock no sooner told;\n\r\n    Than Cleon ran the myst'ry to unfold,\n\r\n    And to the spot repaired, which he supposed,\n\r\n    Aminta meant, from what had been disclosed;\n\r\n    The place was well described, and there he found;\n\r\n    Awaiting at the door, this belle renowned,\n\r\n    Without attendants: sleep their eyes o'erspread:\n\r\n    Behind thick clouds the very stars had fled:\n\r\n    As all had been expected, in he went,\n\r\n    Most thoroughly they both appeared content;\n\r\n    Few words were used: in haste the pair withdrew,\n\r\n    Where ev'ry wish at ease they might pursue.\n\r\n    The smart gallant at once her beauty praised;\n\r\n    His admiration presently was raised;\n\r\n    Sweet kindness followed; charms were oft admired;\n\r\n    And all was managed as their hearts desired.\n\n\n\r\n    SAID youthful Cleon, now you'll tell me why\n\r\n    This stratagem you were induced to try?\n\r\n    For such before in love was never seen;\n\r\n    'Tis excellent, and worthy Beauty's queen.\n\r\n    A lovely blush o'erspread Aminta's face,\n\r\n    And gave her lily-cheeks superior grace.\n\r\n    He praised her person, artifice, and wit,\n\r\n    And did whate'er the moments would admit."}
